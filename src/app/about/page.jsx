            <p >Our tutors are highly trained, disciplined and knowledgeable teachers who give their best as they yearn for knowledge and disseminate knowledge the best way possible. Our interest in tutoring sprung up from our desire to affect lives positively; the lives of those who struggle with learning and the vast populace to delve deeper in learning beyond the basics.

              To be able to change the narrative of education being done in a stringent unappealing way, to a fun, impactful and interesting way- like a delicious meal, we will be adding a little spice to education and rendering the service of deciphering issues or problems children face in schools. We render consultancy services for free to families who call on us.  </p>

              <p className='mt-5'>
              In the long run rendering free tutoring services to those who are less privileged through the help of NGOS and our generous sacrifice. <br/>
              <br/>
              In giving back to the society, going to schools in creating awareness on the basic necessities to life, choosing a career... e.t.c through lively  presentations by an exquisitely trained team of Resplendent tutors, more or less a PET project.  </p>
